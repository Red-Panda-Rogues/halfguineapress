Madilyn

:: StoryCaption
/* Used to populate the story's caption area in the UI bar (element ID: story-caption). May also be, and often is, used to add additional story UI elements and content to the UI bar. */

:: StoryMenu
/* Used to populate the story's menu items in the UI bar (element ID: menu-story).
NOTE: The story menu only displays links—specifically, anything that creates an anchor element (<a>). While it renders content just as any other passage does, instead of displaying the rendered output as-is, it sifts through the output and builds its menu from the generated links contained therein.
Examples:
[[Inventory]]
<<link "Schedule">>…<</link>> */
[[Start]]
[[Links]]

[[Tag Names]]

:: StoryShare
/* Used to populate the contents of the Share dialog. Intended for social media links.
NOTE: The Share dialog only displays links—specifically, anything that creates an anchor element (<a>). While it renders content just as any other passage does, instead of displaying the rendered output as-is, it sifts through the output and builds its contents from the generated links contained therein. */

:: PassageDone
/* Used for post-passage-display tasks, like redoing dynamic changes (happens after the rendering and display of each passage). Generates no output. */

:: PassageFooter
/* Appended to each rendered passage. */

:: PassageHeader
/* Prepended to each rendered passage. */

:: PassageReady
/* Used for pre-passage-display tasks, like redoing dynamic changes (happens before the rendering of each passage). Generates no output. */

:: Start
This is a test to see if this is displaying the right stuff

:: Tag Names

bookmark
Registers the passage into the Jump To menu.

nobr
Causes leading/trailing newlines to be removed and all remaining sequences of newlines to be replaced with single spaces before the passage is rendered. Equivalent to wrapping the entire passage in a <<nobr>> macro. See the Config.passages.nobr setting for a way to apply the same processing to all passages at once.
NOTE: Does not affect script or stylesheet tagged passages, for Twine 1/Twee.

init
Registers the passage as an initialization passage. Used for pre-story-start initialization tasks, like variable initialization (happens at the beginning of story initialization). Generates no output.
NOTE: This is chiefly intended for use by add-ons/libraries. For normal projects, authors are encouraged to continue to use the StoryInit special named passage.

script
Twine 2: Not special. Use the Edit Story JavaScript story editor menu item for scripts.
Twine 1/Twee: Registers the passage as JavaScript code, which is executed during startup.

stylesheet
Twine 2: Not special. Use the Edit Story Stylesheet story editor menu item for styles.
Twine 1/Twee: Registers the passage as a CSS stylesheet, which is loaded during startup. It is strongly recommended that you use only one stylesheet passage. Additionally, see the tagged stylesheet warning.
