:: StoryMenu
/* Used to populate the story's menu items in the UI bar (element ID: menu-story).
NOTE: The story menu only displays links—specifically, anything that creates an anchor element (<a>). While it renders content just as any other passage does, instead of displaying the rendered output as-is, it sifts through the output and builds its menu from the generated links contained therein.
Examples:
[[Inventory]]
<<link "Schedule">>…<</link>> */
[[Start]]
[[Links]]
[[The Mokosh Tower|https://red-panda-rogues.github.io/mokoshtower/]]
