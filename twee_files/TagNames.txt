:: Tag Names

bookmark
Registers the passage into the Jump To menu.

nobr
Causes leading/trailing newlines to be removed and all remaining sequences of newlines to be replaced with single spaces before the passage is rendered. Equivalent to wrapping the entire passage in a <<nobr>> macro. See the Config.passages.nobr setting for a way to apply the same processing to all passages at once.
NOTE: Does not affect script or stylesheet tagged passages, for Twine 1/Twee.

init
Registers the passage as an initialization passage. Used for pre-story-start initialization tasks, like variable initialization (happens at the beginning of story initialization). Generates no output.
NOTE: This is chiefly intended for use by add-ons/libraries. For normal projects, authors are encouraged to continue to use the StoryInit special named passage.

script
Twine 2: Not special. Use the Edit Story JavaScript story editor menu item for scripts.
Twine 1/Twee: Registers the passage as JavaScript code, which is executed during startup.

stylesheet
Twine 2: Not special. Use the Edit Story Stylesheet story editor menu item for styles.
Twine 1/Twee: Registers the passage as a CSS stylesheet, which is loaded during startup. It is strongly recommended that you use only one stylesheet passage. Additionally, see the tagged stylesheet warning.

Twine.audio

Twine.image
